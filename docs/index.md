The Moov Ride Hailing protocol documentation site is currently hosted via Github pages. Both documentation of the protocol and example source code for the services is publicly available as [Free Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) under the [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) as a Git repository, also viewable on the [Moov Ride Hailing Github page](https://github.com/Moov-Organization/Moov-Ride-Hailing).

To contribute to this code base, fork the repository, make local changes, and [create a pull request via Github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

**For editing this documentation**

This site is written as a collection of Markdown documents for ease of reading and rendering. Before creating pull requests which will modify documentation, it is recommended to preview the pages in a Markdown engine. If you are using the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/), the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) package is recommended for in-editor Markdown rendering.

**For editing source code**

The services are implemented independent of each other. A locally-hosted sandbox will be available at a future time for full integration testing.
