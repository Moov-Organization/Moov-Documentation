The Moov documentation site is currently hosted via Github pages. All documentation is publicly available as a Git repository, viewable on the [Moov Documentation Github page](https://github.com/Moov-Organization/Moov-Documentation). To contribute to this documentation, fork the repository, make local changes, and [create a pull request via Github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Alternatively, open an issue for any problems or inconsistencies.

This site is written as a collection of [Github-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents for ease of reading and rendering. Before creating pull requests which will modify documentation, it is recommended to preview the pages in a Markdown engine. If you are using the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/), the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) package is recommended for in-editor Markdown rendering.
