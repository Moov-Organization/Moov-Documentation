# Moov Organization Mission

At this moment some of the largest problems plaguing our society are wealth inequality and income inequality. The [top 20 percent of US households own more than 84 percent of the wealth][1] while the bottom 40 percent combine for a paltry 0.3 percent. At the same time, about [47 percent of all new income ends up with the top 10 percent][2] of the labor market, while only 13 percent reaches the bottom 50 percent. This is ultimately dangerous to our society; wide wealth and income gaps lead to [political inequality][3], and therefore instability.

Unfortunately, this gap is also widening. Adjusting for inflation, [worker wages have not risen in 50 years][3]. On top of this, existing labor markets are shrinking due to adoption of automation, which promises a safer and more efficient alternative to human labor. At least 47 percent of current workers are in jeopardy of losing their jobs to automation [within the next 20 years][4]. We are already witnessing the introduction of AI in many sectors - transportation, medicine, and farming among them. Based on current economic trends, these AI services will be owned by a few people, and at the same time replace millions of human workers. This will only further the wealth and income gap as the owners of these automated services collect even larger stakes of the produced wealth, while the replaced workers receive little or none.

With so many livelihoods threatened in coming years, it is imperative that we address this growing wealth and income disparity. To do so, we must tackle the underlying issue: *the oligopoly of a select few owners*.

In a functional capitalistic economy, cost of production is reduced by the invention of new technologies. Reduced cost of production encourages many producers, resulting in tight competition between these producers, directly reducing the cost to consumers. At present, many market sectors have one or two dominant providers, which leads to an anti-competitive system (since there are few checks on prices), and ultimately our current wealth gap. We believe that there are two factors encouraging modern oligopolies: *barriers to market entry* and *the winner-take-all phenomenon in modern (internet-based) markets*.

The first factor in oligopoly formation is that the cost of entering most market sectors today is high. Existing market controllers actively make it difficult to start up as a new provider through [unfavorable regulation][5], [patent trolling][6], and other [malicious and militant business practices][7]. However there are also passive market properties at play. In the case of the autonomous vehicle market, high cost of research and development ([80 billion dollars to date][8]) reinforces that only a very few wealthy entities are able to compete. Once self-driving vehicle technology becomes widely used (and it is expected to become a [massive market][9]), these few parties will retain the rights to the technology and will therefore have market control. So currently, those who create the market dictate who else can join it.

The second factor in oligopoly control is the medium used for modern markets. Much of the developed world has shifted to become service-based economies provided via the internet. Therefore, we are susceptible to network effects - the value of services in our economy increase according to the number of users served. For ride hailing services, the probability of finding the best rider-driver match (quantified as end user price) is directly dependent on the number of people seeking and giving rides. To reduce their personal cost, users follow the provider offering the best match, which happens to be the one with the largest network. This cycle leads to the exponential growth of one or two providers, and the death of the rest. In fact, as soon as a [20% difference in cost][10] between service providers manifests, the cheaper service is able to capture the entire network - winner-take-all. This is the reason Uber and Lyft own the vast majority of the ride hailing market share today. Since competition is low, both companies are at now liberty to charge high rates of commission ([25-40%][11]). At this point, the companies on top have cornered the market.

However, even in the face of these dire conditions, all is not lost. It is possible to topple oligopolies by removing the factors that enable them, and *we the public* have the tools and ability to do so. The key lies in the fact that both cost of market entry and network effects are *addressable* problems.

As listed, barriers to market entry are numerous, but surmountable. In particular, the high development cost of automated systems can be reduced by conducting and funding research in the public domain, and providing open-access collected data. In this way, the public subsidizes the research, but the overall cost is significantly reduced since the results are readily available (outside of verification of the results). New groups have zero-cost access to the existing literature and data, so they can enter the market without having to amass research capital.

Malicious market practices can also be mitigated by opening up research and development. Open software and research have no trade secrets to steal, since the research is free to access. Releasing software under a public license (MIT/Apache/GPLv3) provides certain protections against patent trolling and frivolous lawsuits.

Lastly is the existence of the winner-take-all effect. Presently, network effects only exist because services are segmented; in the ride hailing sphere, each service uses difference interfaces, and all of them are proprietary. The all-or-nothing nature here enhances network effects, since a failure to capture market by one element of the service dooms the rest of it. Here, it is possible to mitigate network effects by breaking down ride hailing services into several smaller services, and encouraging compatibility between them by providing open standards at each interface. Now, service providers can offer one or all parts of the ride hailing chain, conformant to these standards. If one sub-service can't compete, others still can.

We believe that this future can become reality. **Our mission as the Moov Organization is to dissolve oligopolies in the transportation market and help close the modern wealth gap**. We intend to do so by reducing barriers to market entry and counteracting network effects in ride hailing. Put succinctly, we believe that:
- Cost of market entry can be reduced by providing open-access research and software that supports ride hailing services and autonomous vehicles.
- Network effects can be mitigated by encouraging compatibility of ride hailing systems by providing open standards.
- Public stake in transportation systems can be maintained through direct, decentralized ownership of vehicles, even in a service-oriented system.

> @todo need better than a generic "find stuff here" statement

For information on how we plan to enact these solutions, see our [development plan](master_plan.md), [ride hailing market whitepaper](whitepaper/index.md), and [autonomous vehicle stack whitepaper](avStack.md).

> @todo this closing sucks

The benefits of dissolving oligopolies are clear: easier participation by providers in the market, better profit margins for direct providers, and reduced costs to end consumers. We envision a decentralized marketplace where, by system and standard, entities do not have the ability to monopolize service. Only when we ensure that the public retains a majority stake in our own economic system can the public reap the benefits of technological advancement. Perhaps then we could start using artificial intelligence as a tool to promote public gain, rather than further the interests of the few.

This project is dedicated to two of the most unsung heroes:
- Mothers, who nurture life on this planet
- Open source developers, who work to make technology free and accessible to all people
