# Moov Organization Mission Statement

At this moment some of the largest problems plaguing our society are wealth inequality and income inequality.
- The top 20 percent of US households own more than 84 percent of the wealth while the bottom 40 percent combine for a paltry 0.3 percent.<sup>[1][1]</sup>
- About 47 percent of all new income ends up with the top 10 percent of the labor market, while only 13 percent reaches the bottom 50 percent.<sup>[2][2]</sup>
- Worker wages (adjusted for inflation) have not risen in 50 years.<sup>[3][3]</sup>
- At least 47 percent of current workers are in jeopardy of losing their jobs to automation within the next 20 years<sup>[4][4]</sup>.

Historically, widening income and wealth disparity drive political disenfranchisement, and ultimately an unstable and unproductive society.

So long as capitalism remains the prevailing economic model, society will continue to march towards safer, less expensive, and more efficient solutions. Automation and narrow artificial intelligence replacing human labor is no exception. We are already witnessing the introduction of AI in the areas of transportation, medical diagnosis & prescription, shipping, surveillance, farming, cooking, senior care, cashiering, legal consultation and many more. Based on current economic trends these AI services will be owned by a few people and at the same time replace millions of human workers. This will only further the wealth and income gap as the owners of these AI services collect even larger stakes of the produced wealth while the replaced workers receive little or none.

So how do we reverse this trend? Barring direct political intervention, we need to address the underlying issue: *the oligopoly of a select few producers*.

In a functional capitalistic economy, cost of production is reduced by the invention of new technologies. Reduced cost of production encourages many producers, resulting in tight competition between these producers, directly reducing the end cost for consumers. Presently, many market sectors are anti-competitive - even new markets. We believe that there are two *addressable* causes for the persistence of oligopolies today: (1) high barriers to market entry, and (2) the winner-take-all aspect of modern (internet-based) marketplaces.

Regarding (1), existing power structures make it difficult to act as a new provider, through unfavorable regulation, takeovers, patent trolling, and frivolous litigation (among many other practices). There are also passive market properties at play that enforce barriers to market entry. In the case of the autonomous vehicle market, high cost of research and development ([80 billion dollars to date][5]) reinforces that only a very few wealthy entities are able to compete. Once self-driving vehicle technology becomes ubiquitous, these few parties will retain the rights to the technology and therefore market control. Thus, the surviving early players end up with unrestricted authority to charge customers high profit margins to use their exclusive technology, and block late-adoption providers. The self driving car industry is expected to replace millions of jobs and reach an annual revenue of 800 billion dollars within the next fifteen years and 7 trillion dollars a year in the fifteen after that<sup>[6][6]</sup>. There is a high probability that the majority of this profit will end up in the pockets of those who are already wealthy today.

On (2), we must address the fact that much of the Western world has shifted to become a service-based economy provided via the internet. Therefore, we are susceptible to network effects: the value of services in our economy increase according to the number of users served. In the case of contemporary ride hailing services, the probability of finding the best rider-driver match (manifesting as ultimate price to end user) is directly dependent on the number of people acting as both riders and ride providers (people using the service). Since users typically act in rational self interest, they are drawn to the largest providers in this scenario (to reduce their personal cost), which naturally results in one or two monolithic providers as the market stabilizes. In fact, as soon as a [20% difference in cost][7] between service providers manifests, a winner-take-all scenario for the cheaper service follows. This is the reason ride hailing companies Uber and Lyft own the vast majority of market share today. Since competition is low, both companies are at now liberty to charge high rates of commission ([25-40%][8]).

Our mission as the Moov Organization is to dissolve oligopolies in the transportation market by reducing barriers to entry and counteracting network effects in ride hailing. We believe that both of these problems are solvable. Put succinctly, we believe that:
- Cost of entry can be reduced by providing open-access research and software that supports ride hailing services and autonomous vehicles.
- Network effects can be mitigated by encouraging interoperability of systems through open standardization.
- Public stake in transportation systems can be maintained through direct, decentralized ownership of vehicles, even in a service-oriented system.

For information on how we plan to enact these solutions, see our [development plan](master_plan.md), [ride hailing market whitepaper](whitepaper/index.md), and [autonomous vehicle stack whitepaper](avStack.md).

The benefits of dissolving oligopolies are clear: easier participation by providers in the market, better profit margins for direct providers, and reduced costs to end consumers. We envision a decentralized marketplace where, by standard, entities do not have the ability to monopolize service. Only when we ensure that the public retains a majority stake in our own economic system can the public reap the benefits of technological advancement. Perhaps then we could start using artificial intelligence as a tool to promote public gain, rather than further the interests of the few.

This project is dedicated to two of the most unsung heroes:
- Mothers, who have worked tirelessly to nurture life on this planet.
- Open source developers, who have worked tirelessly to make technology free and accessible to all people.
