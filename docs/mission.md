# Moov Organisation Mission Statement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment one of the biggest problems plaguing our society is wealth inequality. At the same time we are also witnessing the simultaneous introduction of AI in the areas of transportation, medical diagnosis & prescription, shipping, surveillance, farming, senior care, cashiering, legal consultation and many more. Based on current economic trends these AI services will be owned by a few people and at the same time they will replace millions of human workers. This will only further the wealth inequality as the owners of AI services will collect larger stakes of the produced wealth while the replaced workers are left with little or none.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some people may argue that wealth inequality is inherent in capitalism and the only solution is to raise taxes on the rich and then implement socialistic policies for the poor. However that does not fix our economic system rather it is a meek attempt to allay its incompetencies by inadvertently giving more power to the government. So we have to work our way back and rethink our economic system. What is the purpose of an economy? Why has capitalism worked for the common man over the last century? What is inhibiting it from working for the common man today?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today there isn't much we can do about human workers getting replaced by robots but according to Adam Smith, in a functional capitalistic economy when cost of production is reduced by the invention of new machines, tight competition among innumerable producers must directly result in reduced cost for consumers. Unless there are only a few producers aka oligopoly then the reduced competition will hinder the process of capitalism by not permitting the cost of goods and services to reduce to the lowest cost possible. There are two main reasons for the creation of oligopolies today:
- __High barriers to entry.__ For instance, in the case of self driving cars, high cost of research and development(80 billion dollars so far) ensure that only a very few wealthy people and corporations are able to invest in it. Once they invent the self driving car technology, they will own the intellectual property rights to this technology and abuse it to keep out newcomers. This will grant them the unrestricted authority to charge customers high profit margins to use their exclusive technology. The self driving car industry is expected to replace tens of millions of jobs and reach an annual revenue of 800 billion dollars within the next fifteen years and 7 trillion dollars a year in the fifteen after that. There is a good chance most of that money will end up in the pockets of the people who are already very rich today.
- __Winner take all aspect of internet marketplaces.__ For instance, in the case of ride hailing services, since the probability of finding the best rider-driver match is directly dependent on the number of people using a ride hailing service, it is bound to create one or two monolithic services. This is the reason Uber and Lyft own about 99.99% of the market share today and since there isnâ€™t much competition both companies are at liberty to charge high rates of commission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mission is to dissolve these oligopolies, that is in flipping the two trends stated above, what if self driving car technology was open? what if ride hailing marketplaces to access self driving cars were decentralized? What if we could translate this model to the other AI services mentioned above?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only inelastic cost in the deliverance of AI services is energy. So if AI services were open, the barriers to entry for AI service providers would be lower which will increase competition which will ensure that costs to consumers rapidly converge towards the cost of energy. Over the coming decades as we enter the age of solar, the cost of energy may also drop significantly therefore opening the door for the cost of our essential AI services to become negligible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps then we can prevent most of the created wealth from hemorrhaging in the vaults of a few people, perhaps that may reduce the income gap, perhaps that may allow power and money to be shared much more proportionately among the people. Perhaps then we can reignite the American dream and grant it to a lot more people in America and around the world. In the age of the blockchain and AI, this is indeed possible and at the Moov organization we are dedicated to accelerate the fulfillment of this goal. We want to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence to empower the people by drastically reducing their cost of living. Thus we may all be able to live in a world where a lot more of our kids have the opportunity to pursue the life of their dreams.

###### This project is dedicated to two of the most unsung heroes:
1. Mothers, who have worked tirelessly to nurture life on this planet.
2. Open source developers, who have worked tirelessly to make technology free and accessible to all people.
