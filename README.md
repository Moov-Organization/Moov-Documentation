# Moov-Documentation

Repository for all Moov documentation (white papers, development plans, etc.)

See the [documentation site](https://moov-organization.github.io/Moov-Documentation/) for more information.

This site is written as a collection of [Github-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents for ease of reading and rendering. Before creating pull requests which will modify documentation, it is recommended to preview the pages in a Markdown engine. If you are using the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/), the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) package is recommended for in-editor Markdown rendering.
